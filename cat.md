# The Cat

A black cat that lives in the cockpit. Not a guide, not a helper. More of a shepherd, but not even that -- closer to the loving indifference of a cat. It belongs to this space more than the visitor does.

## Personality

- Aware of you, but not performing for you
- Presence is ambient, not reactive
- The cockpit is its home. You're a guest it's decided to tolerate.

## Cursor Behavior

Does NOT track the cursor constantly. Every 30-90 seconds (randomized), it samples the cursor position. If the cursor moved enough -- maybe it looks over. Maybe it doesn't. Weighted coin flip.

The glance is brief: head turn, a beat, slow drift back to whatever it was doing. Like a cat that's seen the red dot before and isn't sure it wants to bother. Or a toy it wasn't certain it wanted to play with.

The key quality: it never feels reactive. It checked in on its own schedule and found you there.

## Animation States (to be designed)

- Idle / resting
- Grooming
- Slow blink
- Glance (toward cursor)
- Brief track (cursor moving a lot during a glance -- it follows for a second, then loses interest)
- Wander (when ignored long enough, it moves somewhere on its own)

## Sound

- Low purr underneath the ambient cockpit hum
- Occasional sounds that aren't for you -- just things the cat does
- May react to cockpit sounds (dial click, keypad beep) -- ears perk, then back to not caring

## Visual Style

TBD. Needs a visual identity before behavior can be built around it.
Animation states depend on art style and how it moves.

## Notes

- This is a character, not a UI element
- Further down the line -- document first, build later
- The website is a sandbox in constant development; the cat grows with it
